This project is an end of the year final project for Dan McGlinn's Quantitative Methods class at the College of Charleston 2015. My project intended to create a coding replicate of Helen H. Wagner's _mso_ function within the package vegan. The _mso_ function was motivated by her 2003 publication titled Spatial Covariance in Plant Communities: Integrating Ordination, Geostatistics, and Variance Testing. 

Included in the scripts folder is a file titled runall.R which implements my method on data extracted from north carolina trees. The runall.R script implements both my _mso_ equivalent and _mso_plot_ equivalent both of which provide insight into the underlying factors contributing to species richness variance.
