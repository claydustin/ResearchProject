This project is an end of the year final project for Dan McGlinns Quantitative Methods class at the College of Charleston 2015. My projected intended to create a coding replicate of Helen H. Wagner's mso function within the package vegan. The mso function was motivated by her 2003 publication titled Spatial Covariance in Plant Communities: Integrating Ordination, Geostatistics, and Variance Testing. 

Included in the scripts folder is a file titled run_all.R which implements my method on data extracted from north carolina trees. The run_all.R script implements both my mso equivalent and mso_plot equivalent both of which provide insight into the underlying factors contributing to species richness variance.
